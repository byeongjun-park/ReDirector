    - text: "ReDirector is fine-tuned on Wan-I2V-1.3B-CamCtrl. Our goal is to generate video retakes conditioned on the target camera trajectories, the input video, and its camera poses. We introduce Rotary Camera Encoding (RoCE) into the self-attention layers, using their outputs as camera-conditioned RoPE phase shifts that provide physically grounded positional information. Finally, we employ geometry-aware attention by applying complementary phase shifts before and after value aggregation."
